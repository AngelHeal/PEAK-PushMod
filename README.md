# Push Mod (Mesa Update)

Push your friends with the `F` key! `(configurable)`

## Funny Interactions
If you have the [BetterRagdoll](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Luluberlu/BetterRagdoll/) or [HardcoreParkour](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/chrispavs/HardcoreParkour/) mods, you can press the Push button while ragdolled or flipping to push yourself, messing with physics and sending you flying! (Do this at your own risk though, jumping around on a mountainside isn't very safe!)
Try holding Bing Bong in your hands while you push someone for a funny surprise...

## Important!
All players must have this mod installed to work. You will not be pushed if you don't have it installed.

This is a fork of the original PushMod by boxofbiscuits97, all I did was edit it slightly to make it work on the new update!
